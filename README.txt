Title: University Return on Investment in the United States

Problem Description: This project will seek to analyze the effectiveness of an American undergraduate degree from the perspective of a monetary investment. We will create a return on investment (ROI) metric as a function of incurred student debt and post-graduate earnings to determine the success of the investment in this education. Furthermore, by looking into the earnings of former students, we will study which schools with which features are more likely to graduate high earning alumni over time. This will become a regression problem that will likely depend on the type of school (public, private, etc.), location of the school, major of study, and many other factors. We expect the coefficient weights of the regression model to be a helpful tool for students wondering what aspects of a potential university will provide the greatest return on investment.

Dataset: The “College Scorecard” dataset (https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) curated by the US Department of Education is the main focus of this study. This dataset has 1977 columns with information about both the universities and students, including admissions, cost, financial aid details, loan repayment figures, and earnings prospects. The dataset covers information from 1996 to 2017, with 154,282 records.

Approach and methodology: This dataset holds many continuous and categorical fields. The continuous fields ie. student SAT scores will need to be scaled, potentially via sklearn’s Standard Scaler. Various categorical fields ie. ‘Public or Private School’ will need to be handled via one hot encoding or another similar method so that they can be interpreted by the regression models. Due to the high number of columns, an assessment of possible dimensionality reduction will be necessary. This process will likely involve manual removal of unnecessary columns ie. ‘Institution URL’ and programmatic approaches such as Principal Component Analysis.
We plan to implement the following models to predict a given student’s success based on their university choice: linear regression, Spline regression, and Decision Tree regression. These models will be evaluated using 10-fold cross validation, which will produce the average success rate of 10 attempts of randomly using 90% of the data for training and 10% for testing. This project will be written in Python, using various machine learning libraries, including sklearn, pandas, numpy, statsmodels, and matplotlib. The models will be evaluated using sklearn’s r2_score, and mean_squared_error metrics.
